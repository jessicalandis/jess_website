      "My most recent travel was to Istanbul, the bridge between East and West. Literally, there's a bridge (actually there are a few) that connects Istanbul's Asian side to the European side. Some of the highlights of my trip included a typical Turkish Brunch on the Bosporus, a ferry ride from Üsküdar to Bebek, touring various Mosques, and visiting the top of Galata Tower. Some of the best food was İskender kebap, homemade köfte, and of course Turkish coffee. I can't wait for my next trip to explore even more!",

      "I have always had a soft spot in my heart for London. It's been on my list of places to see since I first read and watched Harry Potter. I was only able to spend four days touring, but those four days were packed with sites and activities. I saw Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden, the Tower of London, the Eye, Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, and more. I even watched some Wimbledon from a pub! Next time I visit, I'd like to have a more relaxed time and wander through the various neighborhoods to stumble upon the hidden gems I know are there.",

      "Philadelphia was an unexpected gem! A trip initially planned just to see a concert, I was very pleasantly surprised. The Love Statue, Rocky stairs, and Liberty Bell are reasons enough to visit. My all time favorite was the Magic Gardens. Occupying space on South Street, it's more than 3,000 sq ft of mosiac tiles and ceramics. We could have easily spent an entire day walking around to see each tile and display. If you travel to Philly, you absolutely must add this to your list. I for one will definitely have to visit again, as I didn't eat meat at the time I visited and missed out on the iconic Philly Cheese Steak!",

      "Australia was the first foreign country I traveled to by myself. It was also the first country I traveled to for more than just a vacation. I spent a semester studying abroad in Adelaide, South Australia during my Junior year of college. Having 5 months to live somewhere new is the perfect amount of time to be able to relax and find your rhythm to live, while also having just enough of a time crunch to make sure you plan all those vacations you want! I was able to visit the Great Barrier Reef, Sydney, Melbourne, and take a road trip along the Great Ocean Road from Melbourne back to Adelaide. This is definitely on my 'Must Visit Again' list!",
